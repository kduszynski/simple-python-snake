# simple-python-snake
Good old snake in Python. Current version contains just simple game logic for moving snake, drawing board and elements 
and checking for game stop conditions. Further elements will be added in future alongside with code refactorization. 

## Technologies
* Python 3
* Tkinter

## Run
As Tkinter is by default included in Python3 libraries you do not need to install anything additional.
Just type
`python3 main.py`
